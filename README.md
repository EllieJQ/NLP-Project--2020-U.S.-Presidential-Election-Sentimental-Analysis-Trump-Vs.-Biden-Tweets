# NLP-Project--2020-U.S.-Presidential-Election-Sentimental-Analysis-Trump-Vs.-Biden-Tweets
In this Project, we performed sentiment analysis by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Donald Trump and Joe Biden Tweets during the 2020 election cycle. The motivation behind using NLP to do polarity analysis on Twitter data is to observe a single measure of sentiment over the high frequency short messages that each candidate sent over a wide range of issues within the relative short period of runup from May 1st until November 2nd. Using NLP tools, we tried to capture insight into how their attitudes were evolving, getting closer to the election day. The way we approached this problem, was by training several machine learning models on a pre-labeled general tweets dataset and using the best performing model on candidatesâ€™ tweets datasets for predicting their tweets sentiments.
