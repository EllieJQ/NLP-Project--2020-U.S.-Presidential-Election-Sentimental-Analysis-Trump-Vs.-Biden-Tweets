10/18/2020,A job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  It's about dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything will be okay.  Too many people today can't do that - and it's got to change.

10/6/2020,"As president, I will embrace:  Hope, not fear. Peace, not violence. Generosity, not greed. Light, not darkness.   I will be a president who appeals to the best in us. Not the worst."
10/6/2020,"We fought a Civil War that would secure a Union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all.  And by fits and starts, our better angels have prevailed just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation.  Those better angels must prevail again."
10/6/2020,The pandemic is not a red state versus blue state issue. The virus doesn't care where you live or what political party you belong to.  It infects us all. It will take anyone's life. It is a virus - not a political weapon.
10/6/2020,I do not believe we have to choose between law and order and racial justice in America.

10/3/2020,"One month until Election Day. Let's do this, America."
10/3/2020,"Be a patriot. Do your part.  Wearing a mask will protect you. But it will also protect those around you - your mom, your dad, your son, your daughter, your neighbor, your co-worker.  Don't just do it for yourself. Do it for the people you love."
10/2/2020,"I'm running as a Democrat, but I will be an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you."

10/2/2020,Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.
10/2/2020,"Donald Trump will do everything he can to distract from the fact that because of his failed COVID-19 response:  - Over 200,000 Americans have died - 26 million are on unemployment - 1 in 6 small businesses risk permanent closure  We can't let him."
10/1/2020,"When I first ran for Senate, we put up a billboard that said, Joe Biden: For all our families.  It's a motto that has guided me throughout my career.  It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or Republican-I'll be a president for "

9/30/2020,You heard a lot come out of President Trump's mouth. Can you name one thing he said to actually make your life better?
9/30/2020,"Under this president, we've become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent."
9/30/2020,Donald Trump isn't a law and order president. He's a president who breaks the law and creates disorder.
9/30/2020,"Show us your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump."
9/30/2020,Donald Trump is the worst president we've ever had.
9/30/2020,"When I hear 200,000 deaths, I think of the empty chairs at dining room tables all across the country, which just months ago were filled by loved ones.  It didn't have to be this bad."
9/30/2020,It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is.
9/30/2020,"President Trump keeps promising to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, but the truth is he's in Court trying to rip their protections away.  And now, he's trying to jam through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him get it done.  We can't let him win."
9/29/2020,"If we're elected, @KamalaHarris and I will wake up every single morning to fight for the middle class. For Main Street. For the folks who keep our country running.  We're going to make our government work for everyone - not just the wealthy and well-connected."
9/29/2020,The American people understand the urgency of this moment. They're voting in droves because their health care hangs in the balance.  But Donald Trump doesn't care - he sees a chance to eliminate Obamacare and rip away health care protections from millions.  It's unconscionable.
9/28/2020,"I'm not looking to punish anyone, but it's about time the super-wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share."
9/28/2020,President Trump can claim he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions all he wants - but the fact is he's fighting tooth and nail to take their protections away.
9/28/2020,There's no mystery when it comes to what's happening with the Supreme Court. President Trump and Republicans have been trying to throw out Obamacare for years - and now they see an opening to get it done.  We can't let them get away with it.
9/27/2020,"On this Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, Jill and I are keeping the loved ones of our fallen heroes in our prayers. May we never fail to honor them and carry their spirit with us every day."
9/27/2020,The truth is the economy wasn't working for folks long before these crises hit. It's why @KamalaHarris and I won't just build back to the way things were - we'll build back better. We won't be satisfied until the economy starts working for every
9/26/2020,The Senate shouldn't vote until the American people do.
9/26/2020,"Supreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions.  The Senate shouldn't act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress.  Americans deserve to be heard."
9/26/2020,"When Ebola hit, President Obama and I took swift action and successfully contained the virus.  After COVID-19 hit, President Trump lied to the American people and said it would miraculously ""disappear.""  Now, over 200,000 lives have been cut short.  It\'s a national tragedy."
9/26/2020,"At this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change.  We need a president who believes in science."
9/26/2020,"If I'm elected, I won't wait to take action on COVID-19.  Minutes after the race is called, I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on.  During my transition, I'll bring together experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.  We will overcome this, together."
9/25/2020,"The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us.  It requires action, not denial. It requires leadership, not scapegoating.  It requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office - to care, for everyone."
9/25/2020,Health care is a right - not a privilege.
9/25/2020,"In the middle of a global pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate Obamacare and rip health care protections away from 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.  Don't forget that."
9/24/2020,"Once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. But what's clear is that today in America, Black women deserve better."
9/24/2020,"In-person early voting should be easy and convenient for all. The Flint, MI City Clerk's office will be open the last three weekends before Election Day for folks to cast their ballots. It's an example that cities and states across the country should follow."

9/22/2020,"200,000 Americans have died from this virus.  It's a staggering number that's hard to wrap your head around. But behind every COVID-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same.  There's a devastating human toll to this pandemic - and we c"
9/22/2020,"Today, we'll pass another grim milestone in this pandemic: 200,000 American lives lost.  Jill and I are keeping everyone who's hurting in our prayers. No words can numb your pain, but know the nation grieves with you.  Today is dark, but we will overcome this. Keep the faith."
9/22/2020,"Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country - and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us."
9/22/2020,"When the virus came, President Trump wasn't thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection.  It's how Trump looks at the world: It's always about him, never about us.  You deserve a president who will put you first."
9/19/2020,We must win.
9/19/2020,"Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg."
9/19/2020,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise."

9/18/2020,"When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us.  When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing.  When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found.  It's unforgivable."
9/18/2020,This election is Scranton vs. Park Avenue.
9/17/2020,"Donald Trump wants to give his rich friends another tax cut, so they pay a lower tax rate than tens of millions of essential workers and middle class Americans.  We need a president who cares about more than the wealthy and well-connected."
9/17/2020,"The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis.   Now, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break.   Let that sink in."
9/17/2020,"If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president.  The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share - and we'll invest that money in working families.  We're going to reward work - not wealth."
9/17/2020,"We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing.    We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine.  The stakes are too high."

9/16/2020,"Donald Trump not only suggested we sell or trade Puerto Rico - but he also left our fellow Americans without the resources they desperately needed after Hurricane Maria. It's unacceptable.  As president, I'll support the island's full recovery and invest in its people and future."
9/15/2020,"As we celebrate the Independence Day of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, we must affirm the democratic aspirations and human rights of people across Latin America.  I'll always fight for democracy and for those who come to America seeking a better life."
9/15/2020,"The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing is a powerful reminder of our past and what remains at stake in this election. As we honor the memory of those four little girls, we must commit to defeating the poisonous ideology of white supremacy that lit the fuse 57 years ago."
9/15/2020,"This morning, parents all across the West - already worried about their kids being indoors because of COVID-19 - are now also waking up worried about their kids being outside.  We need a president who takes climate change seriously."

9/14/2020,50 days.
9/14/2020,Weapons of war have no place in our communities.  We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
9/13/2020,"26 years ago today, the Senate passed 10-year bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines-it was an effort I was proud to champion.  These bans saved lives, and Congress should have never let them expire.  As president, I'll take on the @NRA and we'll ban them once "

9/10/2020,Donald Trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. So he did nothing and created a disaster.
9/9/2020,You deserve a president who tells you the truth.
9/9/2020,"If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone.   Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action - costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin.  It's an unjustifiable dereliction of duty."
9/9/2020,"I promise you that if I'm elected, I'll always tell you the truth.  I'll listen to the experts and do everything I can to contain this virus.  And I'll always put your health and safety first - no matter the political cost."
9/9/2020,"A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine could save countless lives. We need one as soon as possible.  But while I see a vaccine as a product of science, President Trump sees it as a political tool.  Politics should play no role in this. The Administration must answer the following:"
9/9/2020,Donald Trump is incapable of providing the leadership this moment requires.
9/8/2020,This economy may be working great for Donald Trump and his wealthy friends - but it's not working for the rest of America.  It's time we change that.
9/8/2020,"At our best, America has always been generous, kind, and optimistic. We treat each other with dignity, give hate no safe harbor, and leave no one behind.  I believe we can be that nation once again."
9/7/2020,Wall Street didn't build this country - the middle class did. And unions built the middle class.  Donald Trump doesn't understand that. We need a president who does.
9/7/2020,"It's not enough to just thank our essential workers - we need to pay them. As president, I'll:  - Raise the minimum wage to $15 - End the tipped minimum wage - End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities - Ensure everyone has strong benefits"
9/7/2020,"For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions.   It will end on my watch.  I'll sign the PRO Act - making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain - and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had."

9/7/2020,We need to restore honor and decency to the White House.
9/6/2020,"Donald Trump promised to be ""the greatest jobs president God ever created.""  But in reality, he\'s on track to become the first president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered.  American workers can\'t take four more years of his failed leadership."
9/6/2020,It's time we reward work - not just wealth.
9/5/2020,"As president, I will:  - Call for nationwide mask mandates - Implement widespread testing - Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines  I'm ready to work on day one to contain the spread of this virus and get our country back on track."
9/4/2020,I'm grateful for everyone who found work in August and found that glimmer of hope - but there is real cause for concern in this morning's jobs report.  The pace of job gains in August was slower than in July. And significantly slower than May or June.
9/3/2020,"Right now, classrooms should be humming with excitement for a new year and students' hopes for their futures.  Instead, many are silent and empty because President Trump didn't do his job.  America's families are paying the price for his failures."

9/1/2020,"Across the country, people rely on public transportation to get to work, see loved ones, and access essential services. But that's all under threat because Republicans refuse to do their jobs.  Congress must act now to save public transit."
9/1/2020,"Tonight, President Trump declined to rebuke violence.  He wouldn't even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder.  He is too weak, too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it."
8/31/2020,More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol.  Nearly one in six small businesses in this country are closed.  Do you really feel safer under Trump?
8/31/2020,"Donald Trump keeps telling us if he was president, you'd feel safe.  Well, he is president - whether he knows it or not."
8/31/2020,Trump and Pence are running on this: You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America.  And what's their proof?  The violence you're seeing in Donald Trump's America.

8/31/2020,Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?
8/31/2020,We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump:   COVID. Economic devastation. Unwarranted police violence. Emboldened white nationalists. A reckoning on race. Declining faith in a bright American future.  The common thread? A president who makes things worse - not better.
8/31/2020,"here's a lot happening, but I hope we don't overlook the brave fire fighters ; emergency responders in the wake of Hurricane Laura.  When the storm hit, they stayed behind-even while their homes were being destroyed-to help their community recover.  True Ame"
8/29/2020,I believe there's not a single thing the American people can't accomplish if we do it together. We're going to overcome these crises and emerge stronger than before.
8/29/2020,We have a president more interested in beating people at golf than beating COVID-19.
8/29/2020,"The true power of @ChadwickBoseman was bigger than anything we saw on screen. From the Black Panther to Jackie Robinson, he inspired generations and showed them they can be anything they want - even super heroes. Jill and I are praying for his loved ones at this difficult time."
8/29/2020,America was built on a simple idea: All men - and women - are created equal.   It's time we ensured all people are treated equally as well.
8/28/2020,"As we mark the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, we must continue the hard work of perfecting our union. It\'s up to all of us to carry on the march toward equality, liberty, and justice for all."
8/28/2020,"We can't let George Floyd and Jacob Blake become just another pair of hashtags.  This is a moment of action.  It's long past time we reform policing, reverse systemic racism, and make our communities safer."

8/28/2020,"From the moment COVID-19 emerged, President Trump downplayed the threat it posed, refused to listen to the experts, and failed to take action to contain its spread.  Now, we're paying the price."
8/28/2020,"Donald Trump calls himself a wartime president. But now, instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he's waved the white flag.  He abandoned the American people when we needed him most."
8/28/2020,"- 180,000 lives lost - Nearly 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 - Over 25 million Americans out of work - Countless small businesses on the brink of closing  That's Donald Trump's America. We're living it every day. We can't take four more years."

8/23/2020,"As president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus that's ruined so many lives.   Because I understand something this president doesn't.    We will never get our economy back on track until we deal with this virus."
8/23/2020,"America is at an inflection point.   We can choose the path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, and more divided.  Or we can choose a different path, and together, take this chance to heal, to be reborn, to unite. A path of hope and light."

7/21/2020,"Donald Trump simply doesn't understand: We can't deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis.   And for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest."

6/30/2020,"Mr. President, the American people didn't make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rants and tweets.  Step up. Take responsibility. Do your job."
6/30/2020,"I want every single American to know: if you're sick, if you're struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get through the day - I will not abandon you. I will not leave you to face these challenges alone.  We are going to get through this \"
6/30/2020,"As simple as it sounds, we need a president who listens. So much of this could have been prevented if Donald Trump listened to someone other than himself."
6/29/2020,"It's time we remember who we are as Americans: we treat each other with dignity and respect, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.  We are everything that Donald Trump is not."
6/29/2020,White supremacy should be rooted out and relegated to the pages of history - not promoted by the President of the United States.
6/28/2020,Today the President shared a video of people shouting white power and said they were great. Just like he did after Charlottesville.   We're in a battle for the soul of the nation - and the President has picked a side. But make no mistake: 
6/27/2020,"Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves just how unfit he is to lead our nation."
6/27/2020,"I know these times are dark, but I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish."
6/26/2020,"Last week, President Trump claimed the virus would ""fade away.""  Now, we\'re facing a record-high number of new cases, and it\'s surging across the country.  Trump refuses to listen to the experts and take action - and we\'re all paying the price."
6/25/2020,Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through a global pandemic.
6/25/2020,Health care is a right for all - not a privilege for the few.
6/24/2020,"Workers called back on the job deserve access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing."
6/24/2020,"We need a president who will expand access to quality, affordable health care - not rip it away."
6/23/2020,"The American people are tough, resilient, and always full of hope. There's not a single thing we can't do if we do it together."
6/23/2020,"It's worth repeating that this weekend, President Trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in the middle of a global pandemic.  He continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation."
6/22/2020,"We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.  We can't stand by and let that happen."
6/21/2020,Speed up the testing.
6/20/2020,Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he's willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines - as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.  Unbelievable.
6/20/2020,"We're months into this pandemic and still don't have proper testing, PPE, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, Donald Trump:  - Pushes dangerous, disproven drugs - Stands in the way of the CDC - Refuses to wear a mask  He is failing even the most basic test of leadership."
6/20/2020,I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for - and we are all called to the cause.  None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent.
6/19/2020,Donald Trump's failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives - and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.
6/19/2020,"#Juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity-but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all."
6/19/2020,The decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the Supreme Court - and the generational impact its justices can have.  We have the power to shape the Court's future this November - and we can't forget that.
6/18/2020,Dreamers are Americans. Period.
6/18/2020,"Here's my promise to you: On day one, I'll send a bill to Congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. It's long overdue."
6/18/2020,"Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy - but he has surrendered the fight.  Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated."
6/17/2020,"If John Bolton's accounts are true, it's not only morally repugnant, it's a violation of Donald Trump's sacred duty to the American people to protect America's interests and defend our values."
6/17/2020,"The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.  It has to change."
6/17/2020,We need a president who chooses unity over division.
6/16/2020,"We have the power to write the future we want for this country. One where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all - not just the powerful.  Let's do it together."
6/16/2020,"We can't forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is trying to gut Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's morally reprehensible."
6/16/2020,"This virus won't just go away because you want it to, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up and do your job."
6/16/2020,LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. Period.
6/14/2020,"In every corner of the country, people are raising their voices and demanding justice. It gives me so much hope.  Together, we're going to transform this nation and ensure justice finally rings out for all."
6/14/2020,We need a president who heals - not one who fans the flames of hate.   We need a president who unites - not one who sows further discord for political gain.   We need a president who leads the way with a steady hand - not one who incites violence with his erratic tweets.
6/14/2020,"We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our nation's history - and it's clear Donald Trump isn't up for the job.  We need real leadership, right now."

6/13/2020,We need a national ban on chokeholds. Now.
6/13/2020,"I've said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is truer today than ever. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation.   We can't let that happen."
6/12/2020,"Medgar Evers once said, ""freedom has never been free."" On this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters. He was gunned down fighting to end racial injustice. We must honor him by carrying forward that cause in our own lives today."
6/12/2020,"We need real policing reform, and we need it now. Congress should immediately:  - Outlaw chokeholds - Improve oversight and accountability - Create a model use of force standard - Stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces"
6/12/2020,"Donald Trump forgot about COVID-19, but COVID-19 didn't forget about us.   The President couldn't wish away the virus in April, he couldn't tweet it away in May, and he can't ignore it away in June."
6/12/2020,We need a president who chooses hope over fear.
6/11/2020,"Folks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. It puts the very integrity of our elections at risk.   We simply cannot let it happen again in 2020."
6/11/2020,It's in our darkest moments that we've produced some of our greatest progress - and we have that opportunity once again. Let's make this a moment of action to address systemic racism and propel our nation into an era of true equality and opportunity.
6/10/2020,Nothing about the fights we're facing will be easy. Racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years.    But I'm ready to get to work on day one. We can't accept anything less from an American president.
6/10/2020,"America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We've never fully lived up to that promise - and we can't rest until we finally do."
6/10/2020,"Because of Donald Trump's negligence and incompetence:   - More than 110,000 people have died - We have nearly 2 million cases of COVID-19 - Over 20 million Americans are out of work   And yet he's patting himself on the back. Unbelievable."
6/9/2020,Let me be clear: We can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing.   We need justice. We need action. We need reform.
6/9/2020,My Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.  Whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.  I'm a Catholic - just like Martin. Our faith says that we can't accept either.
6/8/2020,"We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what's really going on in this country.   It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions."
6/8/2020,American history isn't a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. But we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.  Don't let anyone tell you differently.
6/8/2020,Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.
6/7/2020,"The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.   We cannot give him another four years in the White House."
6/7/2020,We need to stand up as a nation - with the Black community and with all minority communities - and come together as one America. Because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.   It is the duty of every American to grapple with it - and grapple with it now.
6/6/2020,I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn't just become another hashtag - and I intend to keep that promise.   We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again.
6/6/2020,"Today, we honor those who answered duty's call on June 6, 1944, on the beachheads of Normandy. We must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice-and recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. #DDay"
6/6/2020,150 days.
6/5/2020,"This #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I am reflecting on the life of Hadiya Pendleton, whose murder inspired the #WearOrange movement.  The hard truth is that Black Americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. It has to stop."
6/5/2020,Let's be clear about something: The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God - but to the failure of a President.
6/5/2020,It is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all of our people.
6/5/2020,"We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.   We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us.   We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us."
6/5/2020,We can't take four more years of this.
6/4/2020,"It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I'll do my job and take responsibility. I won't blame others. And I'll never forget that the job isn't about me - it's about you."

6/3/2020,"If we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. A more equal, more just, more hopeful nation - closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be."
6/3/2020,"I ask all of America - not to deny our pain or cover it over - but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy."
6/3/2020,"If the Senate has time to confirm Donald Trump's unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution's promise of equal protection under the law.  No more excuses. No more delays."
6/3/2020,"When 100,000 Americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.  When Americans peacefully protested outside the White House, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.  Donald Trump was elected to serve us all - but he only looks out for himself."
6/2/2020,I've said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.  Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important-who we want to be. It's all at stake.   That is truer today than ever. And it's in this urgency we can find the 
6/2/2020,"The President held up a bible at St. John's church yesterday. If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something:   That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves.   That's hard work. But it's the work of America."
6/2/2020,"A country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time."
6/1/2020,"In this moment, the very soul of America is at stake.   We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.   We have to finally make real the American promise: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives."
5/30/2020,"If we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.  None of us can turn away. We all have an obligation to speak out."
5/30/2020,This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.  This is a national crisis - and we need real leadership right now.
5/29/2020,"It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.  It's time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.  We need justice for George Floyd."
5/29/2020,Enough.
5/28/2020,"100,000+ lives lost across the country. 1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases. 40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.  Donald Trump has failed our nation."
5/28/2020,The hard truth is that this crisis didn't have to be this bad.
5/27/2020,"We're in the middle of a global pandemic - and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he's also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.  It's morally reprehensible."
5/27/2020,"Last year California passed #AB5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.  Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.  I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November."
5/27/2020,Wear a mask.
5/27/2020,"Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.  We need a government that works for all - not just the super-wealthy."
5/26/2020,1 in 4 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. It's a crisis unlike anything we've seen in our lifetime - and the Trump Administration is failing to do enough to help.
5/26/2020,So much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself.
5/26/2020,There's not a single thing the American people can't do if we do it together.
5/25/2020,"We have always been able to take crises and turn them into opportunities - and we have the chance to do that once again. If we match our ambitions to the scale of the challenges we face, we can and will transform our country for generations to come."
5/24/2020,The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn't prepared for that. I promise you I will be.
5/24/2020,Climate change poses an existential threat to our future - and time is running out to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle the challenge head-on.

5/23/2020,"The hard truth is Donald Trump ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.  It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history."
5/22/2020,"In the middle of this crisis, President Trump is trying to cut food assistance. It's morally bankrupt.  We should do everything in our power to ensure no one goes hungry in America."
5/21/2020,"When I launched my campaign, I said we were in a battle for the soul of the nation - we're seeing that soul on full display. Folks are reaching out to help one another and doing truly heroic things. It makes me so proud."
5/20/2020,Donald Trump needs to do his job and implement a national testing strategy.
5/20/2020,"Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose to unite rather than divide."
5/20/2020,"When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were before. We need to take this country to a place we've never been. Where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the American dream."
5/20/2020,The United States of America has always emerged stronger from every trial and tribulation - and we will again. We will overcome this.
5/20/2020,"During today's Senate Banking Committee hearing, Secretary @StevenMnuchin1 refused to require corporations benefiting from $500 billion in CARES Act funds to keep workers on their payrolls. @EWarren asked him several times, each time he ducked and refused."
5/19/2020,We need a president who believes in science.
5/19/2020,It's time we reward the people who actually make this country work. Not Wall Street CEOs - but the middle class. Ordinary women and men who are capable of doing extraordinary things when given half a chance.  That's who I'll fight for every single day in the White House.
5/19/2020,Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus. But he does bear full responsibility for failing to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime.

5/18/2020,"A year ago today, the House passed the #EqualityAct, a long-overdue bill that would ensure LGBTQ+ people are treated with dignity and respect under the law. But @SenateMajLdr won't bring it up for a vote. It's unacceptable.  Passing it will be a top legislative priority of mine."
5/17/2020,"As we reflect on the incredible legacy of Brown v. Board of Education, we're reminded of the urgent work that remains before us 66 years later. We can't rest until every kid gets a fair shot, and we finally live up to our founding ideals of liberty, justice, and equality for all."
5/17/2020,Behind every COVID-19 death is a family and a community that will never be the same.  Behind every unemployment claim is a life thrown into uncertainty - a person wondering how they'll make ends meet.  There is a real human toll to this crisis. We cannot forget that.

5/16/2020,Science over fiction.

5/15/2020,"Trump's international failures have cleared a path for Cuba to join the UN Human Rights Council. This would betray Cuba's political prisoners and further undermine U.S. diplomacy. As President, I will lead by empowering the Cuban people and defending human rights."

5/12/2020,I believe everyone deserves a fair shot at success - not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd.
5/11/2020,Donald Trump and his team seem to understand how critical testing is to their own safety. So why are they insisting that it's unnecessary for the American people?

5/8/2020,Donald Trump loves to crow about what a great economy he built.  This crisis has revealed what a failure Trumponomics has been. And American workers and families are paying the price.   Tune in for my remarks live on @nowthisnews at 12 PM EDT.
